On the Command Line -> 

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

This will create a new React app in a folder called my-app. It will also start a development server so you can see your app in action.

After making the React App; Getting Started on Task 1 (Reffering to Task1.txt)

I Choose to use React Bootstrap for the UI. 

To install React Bootstrap in your React app, you need to install the following packages:

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

Installed React Bootstrap and Bootstrap.

Used normal JS and react, made a Plain UI with 2 Questions and 2 Radio Buttons each.

screenshots stored in Task1 folder. as Task1_1.png 

As the UI has all the radio buttons in the same Line; I will Try to make it into 2 columns. 

I used form-check; form-check-input ; from Bootstrap to style the radio buttons and labels, and the row and col-sm-6 classes to the split the colums into two columns.

I have used the following components from React Bootstrap:  Form, Button, Row, Col, FormCheck, FormCheckInput, FormCheckLabel
